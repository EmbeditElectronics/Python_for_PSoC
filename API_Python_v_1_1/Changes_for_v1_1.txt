**API changes for V1.1**

TEST THE DACS!!!

Add support for max number of components (58 pins/24 PWM's, etc.)

Add class attributes to RPiSoC to indicate whether an address is in use or not, bring up a run-time error if a component tries to get re-initialized.

//Add frequency modification to the PWM clocks

//Add frequency READING to the PWM clocks and WaveDAC clocks

Add I2C support; possibly UART

//use micro Volts instead of milli for Voltage conversion (more decimal //places)...

Add drive mode modification for pins.

//Do the bit masking for pins on the PSoC side, waste of time on the Pi side.

Add a "cleanup" function to the RPiSoC class to clear everything on the PSoC.

FIX THE WAVEDAC OFFICIALLY

MAKE AN INSTALL SCRIPT

use atexit to clean up the commchannel instead of keyboard interrupt.

**API Changes for V2**

Interrupt handling on the PSoC for each commchannel.

Multi-threading the Pi side so that it doesn't get hung up with the data transfers.

defintely UART, possibly USB support

Add unique delay variable for each transfer request instead of hardcoded one; some can get away with very little delay. Requires TESTING.
