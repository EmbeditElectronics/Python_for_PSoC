    **Description:**

                    * Port *4* does not contain Pin *7* (it is reserved)
                    * Port 5 uses 3.3V logic instead of 5V.

             - *PIN*: Pin relative to the chosen Port.
                    * Valid arguments are between *0* and *7*, unless noted to have a Port specific exception, or if that pin is removed from your RPiSoC schematic.

             - *CONFIG:* drive mode of the pin. Valid choices are:
                    * 'IN' - sets pin as input
                    * 'OUT' - sets pin as output
                    * 'PULL_UP' - sets pin as resisitive pullup
                    * 'PULL_DWN' - sets pin as resistive pulldown
                    * 'OPEN_DRAIN_LO' - sets pin as open-drain (drives low)
                    * 'OPEN_DRAIN_HI' - sets pin as open-drain (drives high)

        **Note:**
            Modification of which pins are available should be easy. Just add new pins to you RPiSoC schematic, give them an input and an output, and then name them as GPIO_PORT_PIN.
            After you do this, confirm that it was done correctly by using the DEBUG feature of the RPiSoC class.
