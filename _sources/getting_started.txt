Getting Started
===============
Here is everything you should need to get yourself moving with development on the RPiSoC through the Raspberry Pi! 

Using the RPiSoC
++++++++++++++++
If you're new to the RPiSoC, it would greatly benefit you to read through its documentation before going any further. The documentation can be found here:

	- https://github.com/EmbeditElectronics/RPiSoC_Bootloader/blob/master/RPiSoC_RevC_User_Guide.pdf

Pay special attention to the sections discussing how to download a program to the board using the Bootloader Host Tool. 


Program your RPiSoC
+++++++++++++++++++
Once you know how to program the RPiSoC, you're ready to go! Just download the PSoC Creator project from git and download it to the RPiSoC. 

	- https://github.com/EmbeditElectronics/psoc_2_pi/tree/master/PSoC%20Creator

Download the Python files from git
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
First, make sure that you have git installed on your raspberry Pi. From the terminal
window::
	sudo apt-get install git-core

Then, create a folder for the RPiSoC API, and download it from 
git::
	git clone https://github.com/EmbeditElectronics/psoc_2_pi.git

Download spidev
+++++++++++++++

Now, to use the API on the Raspberry Pi, you will need to have the SPI bus enabled, and you will need to have the spidev ibraries installed and in your working directory. Luckily, this is a very easy process. First though, you will need to do an update/upgrade on your pi. Open a new terminal window and enter the following 
commands::
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo reboot

Next, you will need to install the python-dev libraries, if they aren't already 
installed::
	sudo apt-get install python-dev

Now you need to enable the SPI bus on your Pi, which is disabled by default to speed up the boot 
process::
	sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf

This will bring up a text editor where you will find a line that 
reads::
	spi-bcm2708

Simply comment this line out by adding a *#* to the front of it, and reboot your 
pi::
	sudo reboot

Now, navigate to your working directory, the one with the API downloaded to it, and make a new directory for 
spidev::
	mkdir python-spi
	cd python-spi
	wget https://raw.github.com/doceme/py-spidev/master/setup.py
	wget https://raw.github.com/doceme/py-spidev/master/spidev_module.c
	sudo python setup.py install

And now you should be good to go!
